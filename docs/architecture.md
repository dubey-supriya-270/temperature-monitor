# Architecture Diagram - Real-Time Temperature Monitoring System

This diagram outlines the architecture for a scalable, real-time temperature monitoring system using modern microservices architecture.

## Architecture Overview
The system consists of the following components:
- **Frontend (React.js)**: A responsive user interface that visualizes temperature data in real-time.
- **Backend (Node.js + Express)**: A service that handles data processing, WebSocket communication, and interactions with the database.
- **Database (MongoDB)**: A high-performance database for storing temperature data and system configurations.
- **WebSocket (Socket.IO)**: Real-time communication between the frontend and backend for live data updates.
- **Redis**: A message broker that manages the distribution of real-time temperature data between services.

### Flow of Data
1. **Sensors** generate temperature data in real-time.
2. The **Backend Service (Node.js)** receives the data from sensors and processes it.
3. The processed data is sent to **MongoDB** for storage.
4. **Redis** acts as a message broker, enabling real-time communication and distribution of temperature data to multiple clients.
5. The backend communicates with the **Frontend (React.js)** via **Socket.IO** to update the user interface in real-time.

### Key Components:
- **Frontend (React.js)**:
  - Real-time display of temperature data.
  - User-friendly interface for monitoring and visualizing temperature trends.
  - WebSocket client for receiving live data.

- **Backend (Node.js)**:
  - RESTful API for managing data requests and interactions.
  - WebSocket server for real-time communication with the frontend.
  - Interfaces with MongoDB to store temperature readings.
  - Redis is used for handling message distribution to ensure efficient real-time communication.

- **Database (MongoDB)**:
  - Stores raw temperature data and historical trends for quick reads and writes.

- **Redis**:
  - Acts as a message broker to distribute temperature updates to multiple services or frontend clients.

### Scaling and Distributed Considerations:
- **Microservices**: Each component is loosely coupled and can scale independently, ensuring better fault tolerance and easier maintenance.
- **WebSocket**: Optimized for low-latency communication and scalability in a high-traffic environment.
- **Redis**: Handles real-time messaging efficiently across services to minimize delays and increase performance.
- **Docker**: All services (frontend, backend, database, and message broker) are containerized to ensure easy deployment and scalability.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React.js, Socket.IO
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Message Broker**: Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (optional for scaling)

## Conclusion
This architecture ensures a scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-performance system for real-time temperature monitoring with a focus on service-oriented architecture, efficient real-time data distribution using Redis, and real-time data visualization.
